showcasing my Arch Linux build (config files, etc.)

## Video Player
[mpv](https://mpv.io/)

## Backup
To backup my Arch Distro i will use the ```rsync``` package. For now I will just keep the backups in an external hard drive, but in the future I would like to setup a recurrent backup saved somewhere in the cloud (maybe use raspberry? idk)
